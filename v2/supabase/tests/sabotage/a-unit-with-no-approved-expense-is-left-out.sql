-- Sabotage: a-unit-with-no-approved-expense-is-left-out
-- Breaks: sql:CNT-01
-- Expect: every paid unit counts: cost 0 and Provisional with no approved expense, the pending one left out, Ready when done or no supplier cost; the wallet part is not revenue; a published unit and an excluded one do not count
-- Only Ready units count; a paid unit with no approved expense is left out of the totals (V611).
