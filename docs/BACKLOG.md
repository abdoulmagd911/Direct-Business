# Action items — things deliberately put on hold

Living list. Every session should read this and update it. Nothing here is forgotten,
it is *parked*, and each item says why and what "done" looks like.

Last reviewed: **2026-08-10**

### Shipped 2026-08-10 — four screenshot-verified defects fixed (live)
- **Finance "Income by service line" told a false story** — it showed the service fee as
  the *entire* gross billed and 100% margin on every row, contradicting the Profit tile
  above it. Fee now = revenue − cost (Flights 43.0K / 7%, all-services 68.5K = the Profit
  tile exactly).
- **The record detail header painted buttons over the company name.** Injected button
  groups (Create offer / New booking, HQ / Maps) crushed the flexible name column to 0px.
  The row now wraps and the name column keeps a real minimum width (`v58` style block).
- **The Operations kanban collapsed into 150px columns with cards spilling across them.**
  Cause: the v26 "KPI grid" heuristic (any div with 4+ numbers becomes a stat grid) was
  stamping the board, its columns and its cards. The board, tables and timelines are now
  excluded — and the same guard stops the v26.3 Insights drawer from hiding the Leads
  table as an "aggregate block".
- **The Leads list ignored its own data** — every row showed "—" for Last activity and
  Next action. `rowToApp` now derives `lastContact` from the newest logged activity and
  maps `created_at`/`converted_date`; the Next-action cell falls back to the follow-up
  date; the conversion rate is now won ÷ all leads (was won ÷ decided = a meaningless
  100%). Strip verified: 10 new this month · 4 in pipeline · 60% · 9 days.

### Shipped 2026-08-09 (live)
- **Declutter of Leads / Clients / Finance** — removed the dead "Open in Direct" columns,
  scoped the "Has app" filter to Leads, removed the empty "Active" client chip, fixed the
  "At risk" client chip (was matching nothing), and fixed the Export dropdown so its items
  return to English when the app is switched back from Arabic.
- **Client health** badge (Good / Watch / At risk / New), **lead Priority** column
  (Hot/Warm/Cool/Cold, sortable), and a **leads Conversion strip** (new this month, in
  pipeline, conversion %, avg time to win).
- **Leads stage chips now actually filter** the table (they used to highlight but do nothing),
  with truthful leads-only counts. This closes the "next thing to fix" that was in the
  known-issues list.

## 1 · Data consolidation across Google Drive — **biggest open job**

The work was done across multiple devices and multiple assistant sessions, so the same
entity appears in several sheets with different details, and dozens of working files were
created that nobody has reconciled.

**Goal:** one record per real entity, carrying every detail found anywhere, with a note of
which files each detail came from.

Known sources, all confirmed present in Drive:

| File | Folder | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `TravelAgencies_MASTER.xlsx` | `1cj5eHEHKZbRPWwV6_1kCPZBYikZDhOw6` | 693 KB |
| `Contacts Submissions` (live Google Sheet) | My Drive | 42 KB |
| `B2B` (Google Sheet, actively edited) | My Drive | 70 KB |
| `CONTACT-FORM-B2B-STAGING.csv` | `1G2JAtDs9z-m3M4rJncrnKy_NClDvgUou` | 81 KB |
| `CONTACT-FORM-CLASSIFIED.csv` | same | 33 KB |
| `CONTACT-FORM-MERGE-PLAN.csv` | same | 13 KB |
| `VENDORS-FROM-CONTACT-FORM.csv` | same | 4 KB |
| `CALL-SHEET-WEBSITE-FORM-LEADS.xlsx` | same | 32 KB |
| `CALLING-LIST-TOP50.csv` | same | 9 KB |
| ~18 invoice exports `5466…5507.xlsx` | `1F24YUsinyAAz9ntvNaSgJbTfd-8W3P20` | 5–23 KB each |

**Matching rule (locked, from the master brief):** join records by CR number first, then
verified root domain, then exact normalised name, then phone country prefix. Never merge on
a personal email. Where two records disagree, keep both values and flag rather than pick.

**Method that works:** read files one at a time and write findings to a scratch table as you
go, rather than trying to hold them all at once. A single session cannot read every file in
one pass.

## 2 · Travel agencies project — scattered, needs collecting

Travel agencies are a different kind of lead from a contact-form enquiry. They are
**competitors as well as customers**, so each one needs its own offer and its own service
list — you cannot sell the same bundle to all of them.

What matters per agency: online or offline, whether they have their own app, whether they
resell or need white-label, which services they lack and would buy from Direct, which they
compete on.

`TravelAgencies_MASTER.xlsx` (693 KB) is the anchor file. The Travel Trade funnel already
holds **522 leads** with fields for MoT licence, licence status, IATA, city/branches,
competitor-or-partner and partnership angle — so the structure exists; the data is scattered.

The brief also records a pending restructure: split Travel Trade into subcategories —
TMC, OTA, Retail, Wholesale, Religious, MICE, Inbound, Land tour operator,
Government/Tender — and add a BNPL / Fintech merchant funnel.

## 3 · Clients — reset done, re-verification pending

**Done 2026-08-08:** all 32 client records reset to leads. Company names are real; invoice
and detail data was four months stale. Every one is flagged `needs_manual_confirmation`
with the reason on the record.

**Nothing was deleted.** Full copies live in `businesses_snapshot_20260808` (1,035 rows) and
`contacts_snapshot_20260808` (335 rows). To restore one:

```sql
update public.businesses b
   set is_client = s.is_client, converted_date = s.converted_date, stage = s.stage
  from public.businesses_snapshot_20260808 s
 where s.id = b.id and s.legacy_id = '<legacy_id>';
```

**Still to do:** re-check each company against current invoices and promote back to client
only when the data is current.

---

## 4 · Individuals — park, do not delete

Some invoices are for private people, not companies (e.g. invoice file `5468`, a personal
Gmail). They are not B2B leads and should not sit in the pipeline.

But they are not rubbish either: Direct made those bookings as a B2B team, so they belong in
the **finance reporting as "individual bookings"**, not in Leads or Clients.

**Decision needed:** where individual bookings surface on the Finance page and how they are
counted. Until then, do not load them as leads.

---

## 5 · Roles and permissions — on hold by request

Full picture in `docs/ROLES_AND_ACCESS.md`. The one that matters:

> **Switching a user off does not cut their access.** Five tables (`master_db_companies`,
> `app_state_bak`, `generated_documents`, `ksa_events`, `share_links`) are written as "any
> signed-in user" and never check the role, so a deactivated account keeps full access to
> the company registry, the workspace backups, and share-link creation.

Also open: whether `viewer` should see finance; whether `operations` should be able to edit
contacts; enforcing `allowed_pages` in the database or dropping it.

## 6 · Users and logins — on hold by request

- `business@directksa.com` is allow-listed as **admin** with no login yet.
- `aboelmagd@directksa.com` and `a.hassan@directksa.net` have **blank names**, so the app
  shows "aboelmagd" / "a.hassan" in the sidebar and greeting.
- `test@directksa.com` (admin) is the standing QA account — keep.

## 7 · Ownership — blocked on the users work

`assigned_to` and `account_manager` are free text, not links to real users. **0 of 1,015
leads have an owner.** Until this is fixed there is no "my leads", no per-person view, and
no owner-based permissions.

---

## 8 · Arabic — on hold by request

- **135 pieces of UI text** stay English when the app is switched to Arabic (list produced
  by `scripts/qa/sweep-language.mjs`).
- `applyLang()` hardcodes `document.documentElement.dir='ltr'`, so Arabic never lays out
  right-to-left — **and the brand guide says Arabic is always RTL**, so the app is off-brand
  here, not merely inconsistent. Flipping it on a 1.2 MB file needs care.

## 9 · Two people editing the same section

Saves are per-section since 2026-08-08, so different sections are safe. Two people editing
*the same* section at the same moment is still last-write-wins. Real fix: move bookings,
invoices, offers and requests out of the single JSON row into proper tables.

## 10 · Corporate website leads — waiting on launch

`corporate.directksa.com` has not launched. When it does: its form feeds the same funnels,
default Inbound / stage `new`, with a source stamp. Decide whether website-onboarded leads
need an onboarding phase of their own.

## 11 · Stage wording — deferred deliberately

Screen words (`Prospect`, `Qualified`) differ from the locked database words (`new`,
`in_discussion`). Filters and badges now agree, so nothing is broken. Renaming the display
words means touching `LEAD_STAGES`, `LSTAGE_COLOR`, `STAGE_PROB`, `STATUS_TO_STAGE`, `C2S`,
`S2C` and two seed importers together — a miss leaves a stage with no colour. Own pass.

---

## 11b · Two words for one stage — normalise when convenient

Live data carries **740 leads reading "New"** and **202 reading "Prospect"**. Both are
database stage `new`. `stageToApp` keeps a record's original wording when it maps to the
same database stage, so both survive. Both now have a chip, so nothing is hidden — but two
chips meaning the same thing is confusing.

Fix when convenient: set `raw->>'stage'` to one word across those 942 records, then drop the
spare chip. Reversible via `businesses_snapshot_20260808`. Low risk, cosmetic, not urgent.

## 11c · A company can arrive through more than one door

`funnel_id` holds a single funnel, but Bayswater was reached by outreach **and** has invoice
history. On 2026-08-08 the invoice record was merged into the outreach record and the
duplicate archived — the invoice fields now sit in the same `funnel_details`, but the record
shows only one funnel.

Before loading the remaining invoice companies, decide: does a lead need a **list** of
sources rather than one funnel? This affects the whole consolidation job.

## 1b · ⚠️ The invoice-mining work has been started twice, and duplicated itself

Found 2026-08-08 by a full-database duplicate sweep. **Eleven records carry
`source = 'Invoice history'`, in two clusters that overlap:**

| Earlier attempt (Outreach & Network funnel) | Later attempt (Past Invoices funnel) |
|---|---|
| `b_bta` Booking & Ticket Agency | `inv_aug06_bta` Booking and Ticket Agency |
| `b_maaden` Maaden — Saudi Arabian Mining | `inv_aug06_maaden` Ma'aden — Saudi Arabian Mining Co. |
| `b_qahtani` Abdel Hadi Al-Qahtani & Sons | `inv_aug06_qahtani` + `inv_5504` |
| `b_kayan`, `b_maaal`, `b_takamol`, `b_ultimates` | |

A session on **2026-08-06** loaded invoice leads without checking what was already there, and
on **2026-08-08** this session did the same again. Bayswater duplicated the same way and has
been merged.

**Do not load the remaining 14 invoice files until a matching step exists.** Loading them
blind would produce a third layer of duplicates.

**And do not merge on name similarity.** `b_imp_95` "Al Qahtanitravelbureau" and `b_wf_47`
"Al-Qahtani Pipe Coating Industries" share a family name and are **different companies**.
The locked rule stands: CR number, then verified root domain, then exact normalised name,
then phone prefix. All duplicate candidates are flagged with
`needs_manual_confirmation` and a reason naming the other records, so they surface on the
Needs Attention list rather than being merged silently.

Other flagged pairs: `b_imp_133`/`b_imp_60` (Alnoorwings / Al Noor Wings) and
`b_imp_244`/`b_imp_245` (Elite Holidays / Eliteholidays).

**Database integrity is otherwise clean** — 0 orphaned contacts, 0 orphaned activities,
0 broken funnel links, 0 duplicate ids, 0 nameless records.

## 11d · Page-by-page content audit — **DONE 2026-08-08 → `docs/CONTENT_AUDIT.md`**

The full audit is written up in **`docs/CONTENT_AUDIT.md`**. All 15 pages were driven with
`scripts/qa/` in English **and** Arabic, signed in as the QA admin, and every heading, column,
button and helper sentence was captured from the live screen with a keep / reword / remove
call. Nothing was changed — it is a review list for Abdulrahman, because most items are
business-wording calls (per the "do not delete copy unilaterally" rule).

Confirmed live, with root causes found:

- **The Tickets filter tabs are objectively broken** — `Push to sourced`,
  `Mark for void in sourceed`, `Request refund → Direct Paymented`. They should be
  `Issued / Voided / Refunded` (Arabic already shows these correctly). Cause: two run-time
  relabelers (`v21RelabelVerbs` + a second "plain-English" pass) find-and-replace button text
  on **fragments** after every render, so `Issued`→`Push to source`+`d`, etc. This is the
  `CLAUDE.md` "layered find-replace" pattern, and it re-mangles any wording fix unless the
  relabelers are made whole-word / retired. **This is the #1 fix.**
- `Open in Direct` column is a dash on every row on Leads **and** Clients (dead column).
- `Has app` is a filter ("show only companies with an app"), mislabelled and over-injected —
  it even appears on SOPs and Operations where it means nothing.
- `▸ From Direct (read-only)` is a **working** collapsible nav group (Bookings/Invoices/
  Tickets live inside it) — it just looks like a dead label.
- Finance "Top 10 clients" really does show 11 rows; the "Saved to cloud" toast sits on the pager.
- Doubled/garbled headings: `AR aging — AR aging buckets` (Invoices),
  `Objective progress avg of each objective's KPI progress` (Reports); empty `Today · <date>` card.
- **Arabic** is a half-translation with a left-to-right layout (page headings, most column
  headers, and the whole Events + Finance pages stay English; `dir` is hard-coded `ltr`).
  This is backlog item 8 and the audit's Part C expands it.

Audit ends with a suggested order of work: bug-fixes first (§20 relabeler, dead columns,
broken headings — all safe to do on Abdulrahman's OK), then the de-jargon / consolidation
items that need his wording calls, then the Arabic pass.

## 12 · Small things

- Delete leftover test edge functions **`hi`** and **`gstest`**.
- App orange is `#F47A1F`; the brand is `#F06820`. The events page uses the brand value.
- **Escape does not close modals.**
- "▸ From Direct (read-only)" is a section heading that behaves like a clickable button.
- Finance "Top 10 clients" lists 11 rows; its pager hides behind the "Saved to cloud" toast.
- Confirm point-in-time recovery is on for the Supabase plan — the app is versioned in git,
  the database is not.
- `manual-confirm` runs with no login and can edit any lead or contact. Fine while it is
  unknown, worth an auth check before it is shared around.
